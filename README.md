## Experimental - Data Model Library

An experiment for data serialization targeted towards supporting denormalized, wide
and flexible schemas tied to shared vocabulary.

A lot of ideas are borrowed from [Avro](https://avro.apache.org), 
[Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and 
[FIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange).
